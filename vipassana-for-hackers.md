# Vipassana for Hackers



# Target Audience

Should you bother reading this paper? Not everyone associates themselves with the label "Hacker". It comes with a few well-known negative connotations so my first task is to quickly identify what is meant by "Hacker", since this paper is for these people.

My first exposure to the term "hacking," outside of the late-80's imagery which became fodder for the 1995 film, was through my cousin Jennie. She is an Ecologist, a self-described "Mud Scientist", who most people would not associate with the term "Hacker". She visited MIT during her PhD to find the term extended to "roof and tunnel hacking," an idea and practice which delighted her to no end. MIT or not, Jennie is a Hacker. Every Science is about exploration and discovery, and these are the concepts at the root of "hacking."

Carpentry, painting, gardening, the entire field of Genetics, baking bread, Philosophy, electronics, fashion, Psychology, health, writing, and bicycles. Almost any discipline can fall under the banner of "hacking" I'm using for this paper, since almost any discipline can (but does not necessarily) include the potential for two essential aspects of the Hacker Mentality: Rationality and Curiosity.

This is all that is required.

If you have ever enjoyed taking apart a stereo or computer, experimenting with bread recipes, researching and writing, pulling apart the semantics of your work, building something, rebuilding something, exploring a cave or abandoned construction site... I wrote this paper for you. If you enjoy any exploratory vocation or hobby you will almost certainly find Vipassana utterly _fascinating_. The reason is this: As acutely as a human being can disassemble a stereo, examine the slide of a microscope, or explore a cave, human beings have the capacity to disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves.

What may be even more fascinating, for the hacker, is the fact that by practicing Vipassana one can seemingly increase the capacity for rational thought and behaviour.

I have written this paper because, thus far, I have found the written and recorded material on the subject of Vipassana to fall into three broad categories:

1. Well-meaning Neuroscience papers which completely miss the mechanics of nervous-system-based meditation techniques and their core outcomes.
2. Descriptions of a "silent meditation retreat," usually given by someone who has not attended a course. [1]
3. Descriptions of Vipassana from an individual and subjective perspective, usually given by someone who has attended one course. ("Oh my god! It was sooooo intense!")

By using phrases like "disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves" I'm at the risk of sounding spiritual. This is the opposite of my intention. My intention is to pique curiosity in fellow hackers by explaining the biological mechanics of Vipassana, to the best of my ability and as I understand them. To curb the impression that this paper falls into the category of New Age Philosophy, I would like to take a moment to address what this paper is not.


# What This Paper is Not

This not an instruction manual. You will not learn Vipassana from reading this paper.

This is not a white paper. I am not a scientist. This is not science.

This is not an expert's treatise on the subject of Nervous-system-based meditations, nor even an expert Vipassana meditator's description of the technique. I am not an expert. I have only attended four 10-day courses thus far. Each has been substantially different from the others.

This paper will endeavour to avoid falling into the trap of "Buddhist Guys" (a mildly derrogatory term coined by a serious meditator friend of mine). You might be familiar with phrases commonly attributed to this archetype such as "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." Mysticism, mystery, and mystique are to be avoided. If I fall into this trap, email me: steven@nilenso.com

This is not a discussion on "spirituality", for any definition of the term.

This is not a dissection of the administrative details of the course, though I will provide a brief overview of the course schedule.

This is not a description of past experiences, though I will use a few to highlight core effects of the technique.

This is not a comparison with other meditation techniques, though I will address other techniques for context.

This is not an examination of Buddhist Philosophy and will exclude commentary or mention of the following concepts:

* Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha)
* Enlightenment
* Religion / Buddhism
* Prophecy / Prediction of the future
* Telepathy / ESP
* Reincarnation
* "Energies"
* Kalapas
* Metta / Morality
* Sankharas / "Impurity"

These last two bullet points are subject to one exception each.

## Morality's Exception: Lying

A 10-day Vipassana course requires that all students take the standard "5 Precepts" [2], as per Theravada. I do not recommend getting drunk, raping and murdering your fellow students, and stealing their belongings. However, the four precepts which forbid those behaviours are quite clearly _external_, making them components of course administration and therefore not applicable to this document.

Lying, however, is perhaps least interesting in its external form. As an educated adult, it is difficult to say anything at all without lying to some small degree. As one begins to systematically observe the nervous system, which is the basic mechanic of Vipassana, one finds that the brain and nervous system are acutely aware of even the tiniest untruth. If I tell myself my I am feeling something which I am not ("my body is exploding into a billion tiny particles! my muscles are raging rivers of lava inside my body!") the process of empirical and objective observation ends, and the process stops.

Therefore, the exception given to Lying (or the precept governing Lying) is because it actually prevents the technique from working, not because I have some particular crusade against lying.

## Habit's Exception: Sankhara

The notion of Sankhara can be split into two camps, in terms of its definition and use. The first, the notion that the body and mind contain "impurities" and that the objective of meditation is to rid the body-mind of such impurities, will be excluded from all discussion here. The second, more common use of the term "Sankhara" refers to "conditioned phenomena" or "mental dispositions". The Hindi word, संस्कार ("sanskaar") roughly translates in this context to "impression". This second defintion will apply to this paper.

Here, we might choose a more specific term from Psychology: habits. Sankharas, as far as this document is concerned, can be thought of as the ingrained habits of the brain and nervous system. Some concrete examples include liking (or disliking) the taste of olives, my body's ability to type at this QWERTY keyboard without consciously considering each keystroke, and the physical and emotional response I have to news of violence in my city of residence.


# A Finger Pointing at the Moon

The fundamental difficulty in any description of Vipassana is this: It is impossible to convey a description of Vipassana in terms known to someone who has not experienced it. During a Vipassana course this paradox is addressed using two metaphors: First, a story of a sighted brother explaining the concept of "white" to his blind brother [3]. Second, the classic Indian story of blind men each describing an elephant and each producing a partial truth.

The first metaphor is a better framework for explaining the difficulty of writing about nervous system meditations. It is fundamentally impossible to express the experience of observing "whiteness" to an individual who is blind from birth. This person requires sight to understand. Similarly, it is fundamentally impossible to describe the effects of a nervous system meditation which alters perceptions and the interactions of the nervous system itself, since the nervous system (including the brain) is ultimately our entire experience.

The hacker community has been on the verge of this exploration for quite some time. Pixar's acclaimed "Inside Out" attempts to explain the roots of emotion and consciousness in a visual way while permitting itself an indulgence of a tree-shaped Homunculus Fallacy. Combinatorial explosion aside, even one layer deep a child is likely to ask if Sadness has her own internal Sadness or her own internal Fear. Such an oversimplified model may help us discuss tantrums with our Kindergarten students but they don't get us anywhere in terms of explaining consciousness.

Animated films are not meant to epitomize modern Psychology or thought exercises of contemporary philosophers on the problem of consciousness but there exists much tantilizing media targeted at adults as well. The easiest and most recent examples of this are no doubt the works of Douglas Hofstadter. "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" captured the imaginations of the hacker community for an extended period of time, as the term "blogging" evolved from portmanteau to an accessible part-time career for stay-at-home parents. The term "strange loop", coined in this book, has since become a mild obsession of philosophical and artistic computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians, even inspiring the namesake software conference held in St. Louis. Hofstadter's more cohesive "I Am a Strange Loop" tackles the problem of consciousness more succinctly. However, despite directing the reader to Zen at multiple points*, these books do not invite the reader to explore these concepts directly. There is no hacking. A thorough read of GEB or IAaSL is akin to reading all four volumes of Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" without having ever touched a computer or to reading "The Joy of Cooking" cover to cover without having ever set foot inside a kitchen.

I will attempt to frame the self-exploration of nervous system meditations like Vipassana using one tool familiar to the Computer Science discipline: LISP. If you are neither a Computer Scientist nor a Linguist and have no interest in computer languages, feel free to skip to the next section.

Eric Raymond described the exercise of LISP mastery to be "profound enlightenment" [4] and while we can probably agree to ignore the hyperbole, there is something to be said about a language which begins as a calculus and nearly manages to escape formal grammar entirely. LISP has some very interesting properties: Homoiconicity, metaprogramming, self-mutation and self-replication, recursion and trampolining, and -- in the case of modern LISPs and other languages with strong concurrency models -- hardened notions of immutability, concurrency, and the reification of time.

Combined, these properties tend to blur the lines of compile time and run time, of code and data, of execution and interpretation. Decades ago, thanks to these "strange loop" properties of LISP, it was thought to herald the dawn of the Age of Artificial Intelligence. While that did not happen it left us with a fascinating building material: LISP appears to have no upper-bound. It is "turtles all the way up." LISP is _not_ "turtles all the way down", as some would describe it. Even if written on a LISP Machine, there are still paths of wires and electrons which need to be dealt with. These are not written in LISP.

Vipassana would appear to be "turtles all the way down" in precisely this sense. Vipassana is the process of digging through your consciousness using consciousness itself. At no point do you reach the machine beneath the machine: "Aha! I found it! The Consciousness Machine. Now I can do away with the meditation and just read the manufacturer's open specification and I'm sorted." The machine at the bottom of your consciousness _is_ a strange loop. Having a look at this strange loop is a lot more fun than reading about it.

* Zen is relevant because the practice of Zen meditation, or Zazen, is a nervous-system-based meditation similar to Vipassana. The reason I do not discuss Zazan in detail or compare it to Vipassana in this paper is because Zazen, in my experience, is not systematic. The subject of inspection -- the nervous system -- remains, but Zen teachers tend to avoid explicit instruction, leaving the student to explore on her own. The outcomes, therefore, appear similar but watered down.


# Course Structure

For those unfamiliar, I will briefly overview the rules of the course. During the course you are not permitted books, phones, talking, looking people in the eye, touching, making sounds, snacks, music, or writing implements.

Put more succintly, your activities will include: Eat, sleep, poop, bath, meditate.

That's it.

Meditation will consume approximately 10 to 11 hours per day.


# Suspending Disbelief

Before explaining the mechanics and outcomes of Vipassana, I must request that you suspend disbelief about three items for the duration of the paper.

## 1. Meditation is a thing

For the purposes of this document, understand "meditation" to mean a single point of awareness with unwavering focus. "Unwavering focus" means that we can hold sustained attention on this single point (whatever it may be) without getting distracted by thoughts of our taxes, what's for lunch, or that really persistent itch on our ear.

What I mean by this is that mental exercises exist which can take consciousness beyond "flow", "calm", or "elated" states of mind caused by activities one might describe as "meditative" rather than "meditation". Biochemical responses to hallucinogens fall on the same side of the spectrum, though they may appear momentarily insightful.

I have drawn my personal spectrum for sample activities below.

[ spectrum graphic ]

For which we will be discussing only these practices:

[ narrowed spectrum graphic ]

## 2. Your brain and nervous system are tied together in a feedback loop faster and tighter than you could ever believe without experiencing it directly

We all know the classic examples of connectivity between the brain and nervous system: A child touches a hot stove and retracts her hand. A pubescent boy sees a boy or girl he is attracted to and feels "butterflies in his stomach" so intense he vomits. Despite healthy diet and exercise, a high-strung individual suffers from stomach ulcers.

These examples all exist on a gross level, coarse-grained enough that we can identify them externally and even give them names like "butterflies". However, your nervous system is interacting with your brain at every conceivable level. No matter how small, you do not have a thought or emotion emerge in your concsciousness (or unconscious) without a physical sensation accompanying it. You do not feel physical sensation, consciously or subconsciously, without an accompanying thought or emotion.

Unless you have tried a meditation system with the nervous system as its meditation object, you have almost undoubtedly not experienced this.

## 3. Dissolution of the body is a thing

This will be the most difficult of the three. "Dissolution of the body," though strange-sounding at first, does not fall into the categories where we would normally place magic, levitation, or ESP. The term simply refers to our capacity to see _through_ our entire body.

As we investigate this concept, it seems increasingly reasonable in conjunction with points #1 and #2. If we can narrow our attention down to anything we can perceive and what we choose to perceive with our brain and nervous system in tandem is a narrow part of the body, surely if we sustain attention on that part for long enough we will start to see it clearly.

Normally, our attention on our body is almost entirely external: my hands on this keyboard, the itch on my ear, my butt in this chair. I don't tend to spend a lot of energy focused on the sensations provided to my brain by my gallbladder or my stomach unless I have a painful gallstone or I am experiencing acute hunger. Physical sensations provided to our awareness by the nervous system for the internals of the body are largely hidden from us -- but they can be unearthed and explored.

I should note here that in four courses I have not felt the precise shape of my gallbladder or stomach at any point. I have "seen" the shape of my bones in my fingers, shoulders, chest, and pelvis. I have witnessed the rush of blood squooshing through my cardiovascular system (near the surface) with terrifying clarity. I have enough anecdotale evidence to say that it appears this process does work and can be extended to our deepest internal organs and the spinal cord.


# Virtual Reality and The Matrix Paradox

The following section will require some visual assistance, for which I will use the same slides I used in the talk which corresponds to this paper.

They look like this:

[ v2 slide 50 ]

This image is taken from a talk by Michael Abrash, Chief Scientist of the Oculus VR team, at a talk he gave at Facebook F8 in 2015 [5]. I'm using this slide because it's nicely laid out and because it is incorrect.

Abrash discusses the nature of the "Matrix Paradox" [6] as simply the right neurons firing to simulate any particular environment. "How do we know we are not in the matrix?" The question is valid, but the diagram is way off. The following might be a slightly better model of reality:

[ v2 slide 52 ]

I'm going to forgive myself references to Buddhism here for a moment and bring in the Buddhist "6th Sense Door": The Mind. Even when all other senses are disabled, we still have our thoughts and emotions. I'm also going to bump The Mind up to Sense #7 and insert a whole cluster of other senses: proprioception, nocioception, hunger, and the like. Though some might describe these sense as physical "feeling", they are not a subset of "touch", as they correspond to very different activity in the brain. Touch is strinctly an external sense dealing with skin. These are _internal_ senses.

A brain diagram describing The Matrix Paradox is complete when we map all of these senses to the brain. I have not, since I haven't named them all. Proprioception is clearly associated with the cerebellum. Nocioception is a bit more nuanced with regard to the brain's reception of thermal, mechanical, and chemical information -- and whether or not the activity is inbound, outbound, conscious, or unconscious. However, assuming all nervous system activity does have corresponding brain activity, one can theoretically map out the Matrix Paradox on the brain as Abrash has done. It is likely such a diagram would highlight all parts of the entire brain.

On that note, I feel I should introduce an absolutely fantastic RadioLab episode ("Where Am I?" [7]) which addresses this topic of "other senses" from the perspectives brought by modern Neuroscience. With respect to lacking proprioception: “We have words like ‘deaf’ and ‘blind’. We do not have words for being deaf or blind to one’s own body.” In the Matrix Paradox, perhaps this is either a bug or a feature flag.

Now that we have our diagram for visualizing the use of our senses, we can address them in terms of various altered mental states.

# On Attention

The funny thing about Vipassana is that you are doing it already... you're just terrible at it. Vipassana is the inspection of one's own nervous system with narrowly-focused attention but the precision of this focus is not prescribed by the instruction given for the technique. "As narrow as possible", perhaps, but in day to day life a normal person cannot possibly narrow her attention to the size of a fingertip. Your attention is, in part, already on your nervous system, with some degree of focus. To the extent that it is, you are doing Vipassana.

If your attention is not directed at your nervous system, where is it? Let's look at three environmental examples which can help us highlight our senses and our awareness within them.

## Example 1: A bustling restaurant

[ v2 slide 57 ]

...and a corresponding sense map something like this:

[ v2 slide 58 ]

Assuming we've just placed food in our mouths, our sense of taste is going off like crazy, we're hearing a lot of scattered sound around us, and we're also sufficiently distracted by most of our other senses. Note that we are probably paying very little attention to the internal senses.

## Example 2: A sensory deprivation tank

[ v2 slide 60 ]

...with a corresponding sense map something like this:

[ v2 slide 62 ]

Here, the classic 5-sense model fails us, since sensory deprivation only deprives us of these 5 senses. The pods humans live in during The Matrix actually loosely resemble these, which is reason enough to believe that we are not in _that_ matrix. As anyone who has ever entered a sensory deprivation tank knows, it is not like being in a coma. The mind is still very active and it may actually help in causing someone to pay attention to their internal senses.

## Example 3: An anechoic chamber

[ v2 slide 64 ]

...with a corresponding sense map something like this:

[ v2 slide 65 ]

The map for an anechoic chamber may seem surprising. However, just because the room you are in has a negative decible rating does not mean you cannot hear. In fact, in this environment, your sense of hearing is likely to be amplified -- and turned inward. You will hear your heart beating, your blood pumping, your digestive system sloshing around. The better the anechoic chamber at swalling sound, the more intense this experience is going to be.

For this reason, the above anechoic chamber has a record of 45 minutes for the longest period anyone has sat inside it. As it turns out, hearing one's own bodily functions at deafening internal volumes is likely to cause someone to go a bit crazy, hence the highlighted bar for thought activity.

The above three examples serve as templates with external input guiding one's understanding of what is happening neurologically.

# Anapana Meditation

The first 3.5 days of a 10-day Vipassana course are spend practicing "Anapana" (breath) meditation. This period is very important as it is time spent practicing acute, one-pointed attention. If we imagine our attention as a pink dot, the goal is the following clown effigy:

[ v2 slide 69 ]

If you have ever practiced a single-pointed meditation (particularly breath meditations) before, you know all too well how easily your mind can be distracted. Taxes, Mom's birthday, an upcoming meeting, a fun math problem, what's for lunch, the itch on my ear... anything can become a distraction because everything which is not "my breath" is by definition a distraction. And we are not accustomed to spending long stretches of time with unwavering, singular focus. We are especially unaccustomed to doing so with all of our attention focused on our breath.

As you practice Anapana for over 30 hours, you will find your attention wandering less and less, while (paradoxically) the distractions become more and more interesting. The itch on your ear becomes an itch on your nose which seems to move with the breath. Your brain will spend less time worrying about taxes and more time trying to solve interesting math problems (if that's your thing).

On the first day, your attention might look something like this:

[ v2 slide 72 ]

By the fourth day, your attention will often take a shape like this instead:

[ v2 slide 73 ]

If we revisit the notion that "meditation is a thing", we can see a specific example here in Anapana:

[ v2 slide 75 ]

As much as possible, we are forcing our attention to the sense of touch. In the above diagram, our attention is (realistically) not perfectly on a tiny spot under our nose. We are still likely to hear sounds around us on the 3rd day of the course, especially if the sound is monkeys clamboring over the roof of the meditation hall.
