# Target Audience

Should you bother reading this paper? Not everyone associates themselves with the label "Hacker". It comes with a few well-known negative connotations so my first task is to quickly identify what is meant by "Hacker", since this paper is for these people.

My first exposure to the term "hacking," outside of the late-80's imagery which became fodder for the 1995 film, was through my cousin Jennie. She is an Ecologist, a self-described "Mud Scientist", who most people would not associate with the term "Hacker". She visited MIT during her PhD to find the term extended to "roof and tunnel hacking," an idea and practice which delighted her to no end. MIT or not, Jennie is a Hacker. Every Science is about exploration and discovery, and these are the concepts at the root of "hacking."

Carpentry, painting, gardening, the entire field of Genetics, baking bread, Philosophy, electronics, fashion, Psychology, health, writing, and bicycles. Almost any discipline can fall under the banner of "hacking" I'm using for this paper, since almost any discipline can (but does not necessarily) include the potential for two essential aspects of the Hacker Mentality: Rationality and Curiosity.

This is all that is required.

If you have ever enjoyed taking apart a stereo or computer, experimenting with bread recipes, researching and writing, pulling apart the semantics of your work, building something, rebuilding something, exploring a cave or abandoned construction site... I wrote this paper for you. If you enjoy any exploratory vocation or hobby you will almost certainly find Vipassana utterly _fascinating_. The reason is this: As acutely as a human being can disassemble a stereo, examine the slide of a microscope, or explore a cave, human beings have the capacity to disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves.

What may be even more fascinating, for the hacker, is the fact that by practicing Vipassana one can seemingly increase the capacity for rational thought and behaviour.

I have written this paper because, thus far, I have found the written and recorded material on the subject of Vipassana to fall into three broad categories:

1. Well-meaning Neuroscience papers which completely miss the mechanics of nervous-system-based meditation techniques and their core outcomes.
2. Descriptions of a "silent meditation retreat," usually given by someone who has not attended a course. [1]
3. Descriptions of Vipassana from an individual and subjective perspective, usually given by someone who has attended one course. ("Oh my god! It was sooooo intense!")

By using phrases like "disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves" I'm at the risk of sounding spiritual. This is the opposite of my intention. My intention is to pique curiosity in fellow hackers by explaining the biological mechanics of Vipassana, to the best of my ability and as I understand them. To curb the impression that this paper falls into the category of New Age Philosophy, I would like to take a moment to address what this paper is not.


# What This Paper is Not

This not an instruction manual. You will not learn Vipassana from reading this paper.

This is not a white paper. I am not a scientist. This is not science.

This is not an expert's treatise on the subject of Nervous-system-based meditations, nor even an expert Vipassana meditator's description of the technique. I am not an expert. I have only attended four 10-day courses thus far. Each has been substantially different from the others.

This paper will endeavour to avoid falling into the trap of "Buddhist Guys" (a mildly derrogatory term coined by a serious meditator friend of mine). You might be familiar with phrases commonly attributed to this archetype such as "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." Mysticism, mystery, and mystique are to be avoided. If I fall into this trap, email me: steven@nilenso.com

This is not a discussion on "spirituality", for any definition of the term.

This is not a dissection of the administrative details of the course, though I will provide a brief overview of the course schedule.

This is not a description of past experiences, though I will use a few to highlight core effects of the technique.

This is not a comparison with other meditation techniques, though I will address other techniques for context.

This is not an examination of Buddhist Philosophy and will exclude commentary or mention of the following concepts:

* Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha)
* Enlightenment
* Religion / Buddhism
* Prophecy / Prediction of the future
* Telepathy / ESP
* Reincarnation
* "Energies"
* Kalapas
* Metta / Morality
* Sankharas / "Impurity"

These last two bullet points are subject to one exception each.

## Morality's Exception: Lying

A 10-day Vipassana course requires that all students take the standard "5 Precepts" [2], as per Theravada. I do not recommend getting drunk, raping and murdering your fellow students, and stealing their belongings. However, the four precepts which forbid those behaviours are quite clearly _external_, making them components of course administration and therefore not applicable to this document.

Lying, however, is perhaps least interesting in its external form. As an educated adult, it is difficult to say anything at all without lying to some small degree. As one begins to systematically observe the nervous system, which is the basic mechanic of Vipassana, one finds that the brain and nervous system are acutely aware of even the tiniest untruth. If I tell myself my I am feeling something which I am not ("my body is exploding into a billion tiny particles! my muscles are raging rivers of lava inside my body!") the process of empirical and objective observation ends, and the process stops.

Therefore, the exception given to Lying (or the precept governing Lying) is because it actually prevents the technique from working, not because I have some particular crusade against lying.

## Habit's Exception: Sankhara

The notion of Sankhara can be split into two camps, in terms of its definition and use. The first, the notion that the body and mind contain "impurities" and that the objective of meditation is to rid the body-mind of such impurities, will be excluded from all discussion here. The second, more common use of the term "Sankhara" refers to "conditioned phenomena" or "mental dispositions". The Hindi word, संस्कार ("sanskaar") roughly translates in this context to "impression". This second defintion will apply to this paper.

Here, we might choose a more specific term from Psychology: habits. Sankharas, as far as this document is concerned, can be thought of as the ingrained habits of the brain and nervous system. Some concrete examples include liking (or disliking) the taste of olives, my body's ability to type at this QWERTY keyboard without consciously considering each keystroke, and the physical and emotional response I have to news of violence in my city of residence.


# A Finger Pointing at the Moon

The fundamental difficulty in any description of Vipassana is this: It is impossible to convey a description of Vipassana in terms known to someone who has not experienced it. During a Vipassana course this paradox is addressed using two metaphors: First, a story of a sighted brother explaining the concept of "white" to his blind brother [3]. Second, the classic Indian story of blind men each describing an elephant and each producing a partial truth.

The first metaphor is a better framework for explaining the difficulty of writing about nervous system meditations. It is fundamentally impossible to express the experience of observing "whiteness" to an individual who is blind from birth. This person requires sight to understand. Similarly, it is fundamentally impossible to describe the effects of a nervous system meditation which alters perceptions and the interactions of the nervous system itself, since the nervous system (including the brain) is ultimately our entire experience.

The hacker community has been on the verge of this exploration for quite some time. Pixar's acclaimed "Inside Out" attempts to explain the roots of emotion and consciousness in a visual way while permitting itself an indulgence of a tree-shaped Homunculus Fallacy. Combinatorial explosion aside, even one layer deep a child is likely to ask if Sadness has her own internal Sadness or her own internal Fear. Such an oversimplified model may help us discuss tantrums with our Kindergarten students but they don't get us anywhere in terms of explaining consciousness.

Animated films are not meant to epitomize modern Psychology or thought exercises of contemporary philosophers on the problem of consciousness but there exists much tantilizing media targeted at adults as well. The easiest and most recent examples of this are no doubt the works of Douglas Hofstadter. "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" captured the imaginations of the hacker community for an extended period of time, as the term "blogging" evolved from portmanteau to an accessible part-time career for stay-at-home parents. The term "strange loop", coined in this book, has since become a mild obsession of philosophical and artistic computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians, even inspiring the namesake software conference held in St. Louis. Hofstadter's more cohesive "I Am a Strange Loop" tackles the problem of consciousness more succinctly. However, despite directing the reader to Zen at multiple points (Zen is relevant because the practice of Zazen, or Zen meditation, is a nervous-system-based meditation similar to Vipassana), these books do not invite the reader to explore these concepts directly. There is no hacking. A thorough read of GEB or IAaSL is akin to reading all four volumes of Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" without having ever touched a computer or to reading "The Joy of Cooking" cover to cover without having ever set foot inside a kitchen.

I will attempt to frame the self-exploration of nervous system meditations like Vipassana using one tool familiar to the Computer Science discipline: LISP. If you are neither a Computer Scientist nor a Linguist and have no interest in computer languages, feel free to skip to the next section.

Eric Raymond described the exercise of LISP mastery to be "profound enlightenment" [4] and while we can probably agree to ignore the hyperbole, there is something to be said about a language which begins as a calculus and nearly manages to escape formal grammar entirely. LISP has some very interesting properties: Homoiconicity, metaprogramming, self-mutation and self-replication, recursion and trampolining, and -- in the case of modern LISPs and other languages with strong concurrency models -- hardened notions of immutability, concurrency, and the reification of time.

Combined, these properties tend to blur the lines of compile time and run time, of code and data, of execution and interpretation. Decades ago, thanks to these "strange loop" properties of LISP, it was thought to herald the dawn of the Age of Artificial Intelligence. While that did not happen it left us with a fascinating building material: LISP appears to have no upper-bound. It is "turtles all the way up." LISP is _not_ "turtles all the way down", as some would describe it. Even if written on a LISP Machine, there are still paths of wires and electrons which need to be dealt with. These are not written in LISP.

Vipassana would appear to be "turtles all the way down" in precisely this sense. Vipassana is the process of digging through your consciousness using consciousness itself. At no point do you reach the machine beneath the machine: "Aha! I found it! The Consciousness Machine. Now I can do away with the meditation and just read the manufacturer's open specification and I'm sorted." The machine at the bottom of your consciousness _is_ a strange loop. Having a look at this strange loop is a lot more fun than reading about it.

# Course Structure

For those unfamiliar, I will briefly overview the rules of the course. During the course you are not permitted books, phones, talking, looking people in the eye, touching, making sounds, snacks, music, or writing implements.

Put more succintly, your activities will include: Eat, sleep, poop, bath, meditate.

That's it.

Meditation will consume approximately 10 to 11 hours per day.
