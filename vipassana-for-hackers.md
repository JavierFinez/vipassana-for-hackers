# Target Audience

Should you bother reading this paper? Not everyone associates themselves with the label "Hacker". It comes with a few well-known negative connotations so my first task is to quickly identify what is meant by "Hacker", since this paper is for these people.

My first exposure to the term "hacking," outside of the late-80's imagery which became fodder for the 1995 film, was through my cousin Jennie. She is an Ecologist, a self-described "Mud Scientist", who most people would not associate with the term "Hacker". She visited MIT during her PhD to find the term extended to "roof and tunnel hacking," an idea and practice which delighted her to no end. MIT or not, Jennie is a Hacker. Every Science is about exploration and discovery, and these are the concepts at the root of "hacking."

Carpentry, painting, gardening, the entire field of Genetics, baking bread, Philosophy, electronics, fashion, Psychology, health, writing, and bicycles. Almost any discipline can fall under the banner of "hacking" I'm using for this paper, since almost any discipline can (but does not necessarily) include the potential for two essential aspects of the Hacker Mentality: Rationality and Curiosity.

This is all that is required.

If you have ever enjoyed taking apart a stereo or computer, experimenting with bread recipes, researching and writing, pulling apart the semantics of your work, building something, rebuilding something, exploring a cave or abandoned construction site... I wrote this paper for you. If you enjoy any exploratory vocation or hobby you will almost certainly find Vipassana utterly _fascinating_. The reason is this: As acutely as a human being can disassemble a stereo, examine the slide of a microscope, or explore a cave, human beings have the capacity to disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves.

I have written this paper because, thus far, I have found the written and recorded material on the subject of Vipassana to fall into three broad categories:

1. Well-meaning Neuroscience papers which completely miss the mechanics of nervous-system-based meditation techniques and their core outcomes.
2. Descriptions of a "silent meditation retreat," usually given by someone who has not attended a course. [1]
3. Descriptions of Vipassana from an individual and subjective perspective, usually given by someone who has attended one course.

By using phrases like "disassemble, examine, and explore ourselves" I'm at the risk of sounding spiritual. This is the opposite of my intention. My intention is to pique curiosity in fellow hackers by explaining the biological mechanics of Vipassana, to the best of my ability and as I understand them. To curb the impression that this paper falls into the category of New Age Philosophy, I would like to take a moment to address what this paper is not.


# What This Paper is Not

This not an instruction manual. You will not learn Vipassana from reading this paper.

This is not a white paper. I am not a scientist. This is not science.

This is not an expert's treatise on the subject of Nervous-system-based meditations, nor even an expert Vipassana meditator's description of the technique. I am not an expert. I have only attended four 10-day courses thus far. Each has been substantially different from the others.

This paper will endeavour to avoid falling into the trap of "Buddhist Guys" (a mildly derrogatory term coined by a serious meditator friend). You might be familiar with phrases commonly attributed to this archetype such as "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear." Mysticism, mystery, and mystique are to be avoided. If I fall into this trap, email me: steven@nilenso.com

This is not a discussion on "spirituality", for any definition of the term.

This is not a dissection of the administrative details of the course, though I will provide a brief overview.

This is not a description of past experiences, though I will use a few to highlight core effects of the technique.

This is not a comparison with other meditation techniques.

This is not an examination of Buddhist Philosophy and will exclude commentary or mention of the following concepts:

* Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha)
* Enlightenment
* Religion / Buddhism
* Prophecy / Prediction of the future
* Telepathy / ESP
* Reincarnation
* "Energies"
* Kalapas
* Metta / Morality
* Sankharas / "Impurity"

These last two bullet points are subject to one exception each.

## Morality's Exception: Lying

A 10-day Vipassana course requires that all students take the standard "5 Precepts" [2], as per Theravada. I do not recommend getting drunk, raping and murdering your fellow students, and stealing their belongings. However, the four precepts which govern those behaviours are quite clearly _external_, making them components of course administration and therefore not applicable to this document.

Lying, however, is perhaps least interesting in its external form. As an educated adult, it is difficult to say anything at all without lying to some small degree. As one begins to systematically observe the nervous system, which is the basic behaviour exhibited in Vipassana, one finds that the brain and nervous system are acutely aware of even the tiniest untruth. If I tell myself my I am feeling something which I am not (my body is exploding into a billion tiny particles! my muscles are a raging river of lava inside my body!) the process of empirical and objective observation clearly ends, and the process stops.

Therefore, the exception given to Lying (or the precept governing Lying) is because it actually prevents the technique from working, not because I have some particular crusade against lying.

## Habit's Exception: Sankhara

The notion of Sankhara can be split into two camps, in terms of its definition and use. The first, the notion that the body and mind contain "impurities" and that the objective of meditation is to rid the body-mind of such impurities, will be excluded from all discussion here. The second, more common use of the term "Sankhara" refers to "conditioned phenomena" or "mental dispositions". The Hindi word, संस्कार ("sanskaar") roughly translates in this context to "impression". This second defintion will apply to this paper.

Here, we might choose a more specific term from Psychology: habits. Sankharas, as far as this document is concerned, can be thought of as the ingrained habits of the brain and nervous system. Some concrete examples include liking (or disliking) the taste of olives, my body's ability to type at this QWERTY keyboard, and the physical and emotional response I have to news of violence in my city of residence.
